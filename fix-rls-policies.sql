  # Fix RLS Policies for Appointment Completion

  This script addresses Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues that prevent
  the appointment completion trigger from working properly.
  
  Issues addressed:
  1. RLS policies that are too restrictive for system functions
  2. Missing permissions for trigger functions
  3. Policy conflicts between different user contexts
*/

-- First, let's check the current RLS policies on donation_history
DO $$
BEGIN
  RAISE NOTICE 'Current RLS policies on donation_history table:';
END $$;

-- Display current RLS policies
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'donation_history';

-- Check if RLS is enabled on donation_history
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_tables 
    WHERE tablename = 'donation_history' 
    AND rowsecurity = true
  ) THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'RLS is ENABLED on donation_history table';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'RLS is DISABLED on donation_history table';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- CRITICAL FIX: Create a policy that allows the trigger function to bypass RLS
-- This policy specifically allows inserts from the appointment completion process
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow trigger function inserts" ON donation_history;

CREATE POLICY "Allow trigger function inserts"
  ON donation_history
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow inserts when appointment_id is present (indicating it's from the trigger)
    -- This bypasses the staff check for system operations
    appointment_id IS NOT NULL
  );

-- Update the existing "Staff can create donation history" policy to be more permissive
-- This policy will handle cases where staff manually create records
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can create donation history" ON donation_history;

CREATE POLICY "Staff can create donation history"
  ON donation_history
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow staff to create records OR allow records with appointment_id (from trigger)
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM staff WHERE staff_id = auth.uid()
    ) OR appointment_id IS NOT NULL

-- Create a more permissive RLS policy for system functions
-- This policy allows the trigger function to insert records
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can insert donation history" ON donation_history;

CREATE POLICY "System can insert donation history"
  ON donation_history

-- Alternative approach: Create a policy specifically for the trigger function
-- This policy allows any authenticated user to insert donation history records
-- when they come from the appointment completion process

CREATE POLICY "Allow appointment completion inserts"
  ON donation_history
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow inserts from the appointment completion process
    -- The appointment_id will always be present from the trigger
    appointment_id IS NOT NULL
