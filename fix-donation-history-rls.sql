  # Fix Donation History RLS Policies for Appointment Completion
  
  This script specifically addresses the RLS policy violation that prevents
  the appointment completion trigger from inserting records into donation_history.
  
  The issue is that the existing RLS policy requires the user to be a staff member,
  but the trigger function runs in a system context without a specific user.
  
  Solution: Create a policy that allows inserts when appointment_id is present,
  indicating the record is coming from the appointment completion process.
*/

-- First, let's see what policies currently exist
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'donation_history';

-- CRITICAL FIX: Create a policy that allows the trigger function to insert records
-- This policy specifically allows inserts from the appointment completion process
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow appointment completion inserts" ON donation_history;

CREATE POLICY "Allow appointment completion inserts"
  ON donation_history
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow inserts when appointment_id is present (indicating it's from the trigger)
    -- This bypasses the staff check for system operations
    appointment_id IS NOT NULL
  );

-- Update the existing "Staff can create donation history" policy to be more permissive
-- This policy will handle cases where staff manually create records
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can create donation history" ON donation_history;

CREATE POLICY "Staff can create donation history"
  ON donation_history
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow staff to create records OR allow records with appointment_id (from trigger)
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM staff WHERE staff_id = auth.uid()
    ) OR appointment_id IS NOT NULL
  );
