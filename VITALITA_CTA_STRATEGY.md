# Vitalita CTA Strategy - Conversion-Focused Redesign

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Transform generic, low-conversion CTAs into specific, outcome-focused calls-to-action that guide users through a clear conversion path based on their intent and readiness.

**Strategy:** Layer CTAs throughout the page journey with decreasing commitment levels, providing multiple conversion paths for researchers vs. ready-to-buy users.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified

1. **"Talk to us"** - Vague, high-commitment, doesn't communicate value
2. **"See Demo"** - Generic, no time commitment specified, unclear outcome
3. **No micro-CTAs** - Missed conversion opportunities after key sections
4. **No differentiation** - Same CTAs for organizations vs. donors
5. **No de-risking** - Missing trust signals and low-commitment alternatives

## Donor vs. Organization Differentiation

### Recommended Approach: **Smart Detection + Toggle**

**Option 1: URL Parameter Detection** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- `/how-we-simplify?audience=donor` → Shows donor CTAs
- `/how-we-simplify?audience=organization` → Shows organization CTAs
- Default: Organization (primary audience)

**Option 2: Toggle Switch**
- Small toggle in header: "I'm a Donor" / "I'm an Organization"
- Changes CTAs throughout page
- Saves preference in localStorage

**Option 3: Separate Buttons**
- Show both CTAs side-by-side
- "For Organizations" / "For Donors"
- User self-selects

**Option 4: Smart Detection (IP/Referrer)**
- Detect if coming from AVIS site → Organization
- Detect if coming from donor portal → Donor
- Fallback to toggle

---

### CTA Differentiation Map

| Section | Organization CTA | Donor CTA |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Hero** | "Get Implementation Plan" | "Book Your Donation" |
| **Hero Secondary** | "Watch 2-Min Demo" | "See How It Works" |
| **After Donor Journey** | "See Donor Portal Demo" | "Book Your Donation" |
| **Final CTA** | "Start Free Pilot" | "Register as Donor" |

---

### Principles:
1. **Remove friction:** "No credit card," "Free," "Cancel anytime"
2. **Set expectations:** "2-week setup," "15 minutes," "5 minutes"
