# Email Verification System Implementation

## Overview
The Vitalita donor registration system now includes email verification to ensure donor authenticity and provide better communication channels. This system maintains GDPR compliance while adding essential email functionality.

## Database Changes

### New Columns Added to `donors` Table
- `email` - Donor email address for notifications and verification
- `email_verified` - Boolean flag for email verification status
- `verification_token` - Secure token for email verification
- `verification_token_expires` - Token expiration timestamp
- `account_activated` - Boolean flag for staff activation status
- `activation_date` - Timestamp when account was activated by staff

### Database Functions Created
1. **`register_donor_with_email()`** - Handles donor registration with email verification
2. **`verify_donor_email()`** - Verifies email using token
3. **`activate_donor_account()`** - Staff function to activate donor accounts
4. **`generate_verification_token()`** - Creates secure verification tokens
5. **`send_verification_email()`** - Placeholder for email service integration
6. **`cleanup_expired_tokens()`** - Automated cleanup of expired tokens

## Registration Workflow

### 1. Donor Registration
1. User fills out registration form with email address
2. System validates email format and checks for duplicates
3. Registration creates donor record with verification token
4. Verification email is sent to donor (placeholder implementation)

### 2. Email Verification
1. Donor receives email with verification link
2. Clicking link calls `verify_donor_email()` function
3. System validates token and marks email as verified
4. Token is cleared for security

### 3. Staff Activation
1. AVIS staff reviews verified donor applications
2. Staff uses `activate_donor_account()` function
3. Account is marked as active and ready for donations
4. Donor receives activation notification

## Frontend Components

### Updated Components
- **`DonorRegistration.tsx`** - Added email field and validation
- **`EmailVerification.tsx`** - New component for handling verification links

### Form Validation
- Email format validation using regex
- Duplicate email checking
- Required field validation

## Email Service Integration

### Current Implementation
The system includes placeholder functions for email sending. In production, you'll need to integrate with an email service such as:

- **SendGrid** - Popular email service with good deliverability
- **AWS SES** - Amazon's email service
- **Mailgun** - Developer-friendly email API
- **Resend** - Modern email API

### Integration Steps
1. Replace `send_verification_email()` function with actual email service calls
2. Configure email templates for verification and activation emails
3. Set up proper email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
4. Monitor email deliverability and bounce rates

## Security Features

### Token Security
- 32-byte random tokens generated using `gen_random_bytes()`
- 24-hour expiration for verification tokens
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens
- Tokens are cleared after successful verification

### GDPR Compliance
- Email is minimal PII required for communication
- All email-related data subject to deletion rights
- Complete audit trail for email verification activities
- Verification tokens are temporary and automatically expire

## Testing the System

### Manual Testing
1. Register a new donor with email
2. Check audit logs for verification email sent
3. Use verification token to verify email
4. Check that email_verified is set to true
5. Test staff activation process

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check donor registration
SELECT donor_hash_id, email, email_verified, account_activated, is_active 
FROM donors 
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Check audit logs
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE user_type = 'donor' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Migration Status

### Applied Changes
- ✅ Database migration created (`20250630200000_add_email_verification.sql`)
- ✅ TypeScript types updated in `supabase.ts`
- ✅ DonorRegistration component updated with email field
- ✅ EmailVerification component created
- ✅ Form validation enhanced

### Pending Implementation
- ⏳ Email service integration (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- ⏳ Email template design
- ⏳ Staff dashboard for donor activation
- ⏳ Email notification system for account activation

## Next Steps

1. **Choose and integrate email service**
2. **Design email templates** for verification and activation
3. **Update staff dashboard** to show pending donor activations
4. **Test complete workflow** end-to-end
5. **Monitor email deliverability** and user experience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Email not received** - Check spam folder, verify email service configuration
2. **Token expired** - User needs to contact AVIS staff for new verification
3. **Duplicate email error** - User already has an account with that email
4. **Verification fails** - Check token validity and expiration

### Debug Commands
```sql
-- Check verification tokens
SELECT email, verification_token, verification_token_expires, email_verified 
FROM donors 
WHERE verification_token IS NOT NULL;

-- Clean up expired tokens manually
SELECT cleanup_expired_tokens();

-- Check audit logs for email activities
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action LIKE '%email%' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
