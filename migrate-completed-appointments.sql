/*
  # Automatic Appointment Completion Trigger

  This script creates a trigger function that automatically moves completed appointments
  to the donation_history table when their status changes to 'COMPLETED'.
  
  Process:
  1. Monitor appointments table for status changes to 'COMPLETED'
  2. Automatically copy data to donation_history table
  3. Add comments field with 'Donation successfully completed.'
  4. Delete the completed appointment record
  5. All operations wrapped in a transaction for data safety

  Data Mapping:
  - appointment_id -> appointment_id (preserved)
  - donor_hash_id -> donor_hash_id (preserved)
  - staff_id -> staff_id (preserved)
  - donation_center_id -> donation_center_id (preserved)
  - appointment_datetime -> donation_date (converted)
  - donation_type -> donation_type (preserved)
  - Default donation_volume: 450 (standard blood donation volume)
  - Default status: 'completed'
  - notes: 'Donation successfully completed.'
  - completion_timestamp: now()
