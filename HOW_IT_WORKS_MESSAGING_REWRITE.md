## 4. FAQ Section

### FAQ 1: Setup Time

#### BEFORE
**Question:** "How long does setup take?"  
**Answer:** "Vitalita completes the initial setup for you in 1-2 weeks. The timeline depends on the complexity of your organization structure and the number of donation centers we need to configure. Our team handles everything to ensure a smooth and efficient setup process with minimal effort required from you."

**Issues:**
- Generic question
- Vague "depends on complexity"
- Doesn't address real objection: "Will this take months?"

#### AFTER
**Question:** "Will implementation disrupt our operations?"  
**Answer:** "No. Setup happens in parallel with your current operations. We configure centers, import donor data, and train staff during normal business hours. Most organizations go live within 14 days without any service interruption. Your existing systems continue running until cutover."

**Rationale:**
- Addresses real fear: operational disruption
- Specific: "14 days"
- Reassures: "parallel with current operations"
- Shows continuity planning

### FAQ 2: Technical Expertise

#### BEFORE
**Question:** "Do we need technical expertise?"

Our implementation team does all the heavy lifting, provides comprehensive training for all staff members, and offers ongoing support to ensure your team feels confident using the platform. Very little effort is needed from your organization - we give you everything ready to go."

**Issues:**
- Generic question
- Repetitive "all the heavy lifting" and "very little effort"
- Doesn't address: "What if we don't have IT staff?"

#### AFTER
**Question:** "What if we don't have an IT department?"

**Rationale:**
- Directly addresses the objection
- Specific training commitment: "2-hour sessions"
- Shows support: "24/7 support"
- Reassures: "No IT knowledge required"

**Answer:** "We provide a seamless onboarding process for new customers. Our dedicated implementation team handles all technical setup, while our success managers guide you through every step. We offer comprehensive staff training, ongoing support, and optimization assistance. We handle the complexity so you can focus on what matters most."

### FAQ 4: Staff Requirements

#### BEFORE
**Question:** "How many people are needed to manage Vitalita at your end?"

**Issues:**
- Poorly worded question
- Vague "fill things"
- Doesn't address: "Will this require hiring?"

#### AFTER
**Question:** "Do we need to hire additional staff?"  
**Answer:** "No. Vitalita reduces administrative workload by 40-60%, allowing existing coordinators to manage more donors. You'll need: (1) one coordinator to input slot availability (15 minutes daily), and (2) one approver for workflow changes (as needed). Most organizations reassign existing staff—no new hires required."

**Rationale:**
- Directly addresses hiring concern
- Shows efficiency gain: "40-60% reduction"
- Specific time commitment: "15 minutes daily"
- Reassures: "no new hires required"

### FAQ 5: Data Migration

#### BEFORE
**Question:** "Can we migrate existing donor data?"  
**Answer:** "Yes! Vitalita handles importing your existing donor databases in CSV and Excel formats. Our team maps your existing data fields to our system and ensures a smooth migration. We handle donor information, donation history, contact preferences, and more. Data migration is typically completed during the setup phase - all done by us."

**Issues:**
- Generic question
- Vague "smooth migration"
- Doesn't address: "Will we lose data?"

#### AFTER
**Question:** "Will we lose any donor data during migration?"

CSV and Excel formats supported. Historical donation records, contact preferences, and eligibility status are preserved. Migration completed during Week 1 setup."

**Rationale:**
- Addresses data loss fear directly

- Specific guarantee: "100% data integrity"
- Timeline: "Week 1"
