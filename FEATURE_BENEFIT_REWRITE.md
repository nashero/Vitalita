## Priority Recommendations

### Top 4 Organizational Features (Must Keep)

1. **Eliminate Phone Tag** (Scheduling) - Highest pain point, biggest time savings
2. **End Eligibility Guesswork** (Donor Management) - Critical for compliance and safety
3. **Slash No-Show Rates** (Notifications) - Direct revenue/slot optimization
4. **Prevent Stock Shortages** (Analytics) - Operational visibility

### Features to Consolidate

- **Compliance Made Simple** → Merge into "End Eligibility Guesswork"
  - **Rationale:** Compliance is a subset of eligibility management. Combined feature becomes: "End Eligibility Guesswork: Auto-track eligibility, health restrictions, and compliance records. Zero manual errors, zero paper files."

- **Easy Navigation** → Merge into "Find Slots Without Calling"
  - **Rationale:** Navigation is part of the booking experience. Combined feature: "Find Slots Without Calling: Browse real-time availability, book instantly, get directions and center details."

### Features to Remove

- **Quick Setup** → Move to FAQ/How It Works page
  - **Rationale:** Setup timeline is a sales/implementation detail, not a core feature benefit. Better suited for "How It Works" or implementation section.

## Revised Feature Count

### Organizational Features: 6 → 4
- Keep: Scheduling, Donor Management, Notifications, Analytics
- Consolidate: Compliance → Donor Management
