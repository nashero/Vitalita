  # Fix RLS Policies for Custom Authentication

  The current RLS policies are designed for Supabase's built-in authentication system,
  but this application uses a custom authentication system with donor_hash_id.
  
  This migration updates the RLS policies to work with the custom authentication system
  by allowing public access to donor data based on donor_hash_id matching.
